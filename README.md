# Machine-Learning-Regression
1. Applied Single linear regression using closed-form and gradient descent
2. Applied Multiple regression using gradient descent
3. Assessed the bias-variance tradeoff and recall-precision of data
4. Explored symptoms of overfit function, applied Ridge to revise optimization objective, used cross validation to select the strength of the bias away from overfitting.
5. Analyzed both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms, applied Lasso regression, implicitly performs feature selection, used coordinate descent.
6. Explored nonparametric methods nearest neighbor regression, kernal regression.
